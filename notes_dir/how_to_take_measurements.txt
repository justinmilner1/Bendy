start the camera.
Keep camera running by allowing that main thread to loop for the specified amount of time
Before entering the above loop, start a new thread, this thread will take the measurements

We will not be outputting the pose estimates on the screen
We will be tracking pose estimates in the background, at a slower rate (than can produce a non-latent screen display)

Take measurements as fast as compute allows, keep track of all measurements.
When measuring ends, run a window over the measurements
Take the measurement at center of the window, where the maximum average is achieved.

Add the pose estimation overlay to this image, discard all other images
return the measurement amount and overlayed images to the post-measurement screen.


I'm struggling to do multithreading with kivy, as a result:
I'm going to do an intake phase, then a calculate phase, then a display results phase.
This is a negative because it won't do eager computation... but im stuck.
